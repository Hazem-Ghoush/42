#### Don't forget: all this code was produced in my curriculum, so I had to follow the norm of the school : [en](https://github.com/louregni/42-School/blob/master/resources/norme.en.pdf) | [fr](https://github.com/louregni/42-School/blob/master/resources/norme.fr.pdf)

#### Subjects of projects can be found as ```subject.pdf``` in projects folders.

#### All those projects were realized on macOS, so for graphical projects you can have difficulties to try them.
